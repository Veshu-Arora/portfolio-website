            <small>December, 2020</small>
            <p>I am not a motivational speaker! But i say this because i have experienced it myself. I completed my graduation this year but i was unable to get a job. And for the most part i can say that it is my mistake.</p>

            <small>December, 2020</small>
            <p>I started learning web development in March 2020. It was mainly because of our HOD that i have been able to become a web developer. He gave me a project that was completely customised and asked me to make a web app.</p>

                <p>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'.</p>
